## What

Lua Jam entry.

Fight alien Omuamuas with the power of the moon. Protect the sun at all costs.

## How

Escape: pause game
Left/Right: change earth's direction. Hold for speed
Up/Down: Extend/reduce moon's orbit

## Meta

I noticed the jam late, and didn't have much time.

Due to time constraints, only the very basic gameplay was implemented.
No audio/music or any graphics effects.

I may continue to update this as time permits.
